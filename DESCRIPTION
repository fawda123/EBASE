Description: Estimate ecosystem metabolism in a Bayesian framework for
  individual water quality monitoring stations with continuous dissolved
  oxygen time series. A mass balance equation is used that provides
  estimates of parameters for gross primary production, respiration,
  and gas exchange. Methods adapted from Grace et al. (2015)
  <doi:10.1002/lom3.10011> and Wanninkhof (2014) <doi:10.4319/lom.2014.12.351>.
